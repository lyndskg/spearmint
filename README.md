# spearmint

spearmint is a program that creates a custom, personalized budgeting plan for users based on their inputted context variables, financial goals, and preferences. By considering factors such as total annual net household revenue, state of residence or employment, tax liability (as a % of total household income), tax deductibles and withholdings, cost of living, and more, spearmint will calculate the user's take-home pay and create a comprehensive budgeting plan tailored to their financial situation. 

The program will leverage American graduated tax brackets and relevant financial regulations to ensure accurate calculations and provide users with actionable financial insights.


Key Features:
1. Personalized Budgeting Plan: Spearmint will generate a customized budgeting plan based on user-inputted context variables, ensuring it reflects the user's unique financial situation and goals.
2. Tax Calculation: The program will calculate tax liability based on American graduated tax brackets and incorporate tax deductibles and withholdings to determine take-home pay.
3. Financial Goals Integration: Users can input their financial goals and preferences (e.g., savings targets, investment contributions) to align the budgeting plan with their long-term objectives.
4. Cost of Living Analysis: Spearmint will analyze the cost of living in the user's location to provide accurate expenditure estimates.
5. User-Friendly Interface: The program will feature a user-friendly interface, prompting users to input their financial information and preferences for personalized budgeting recommendations.
6. Error Handling and Validation: Spearmint will include error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure accurate calculations and prevent potential issues in the budgeting plan.
7. Data Security: The program will prioritize data security, ensuring that users' financial information is encrypted and stored securely.


Best Coding Languages:
The best coding languages for this project would include Python and JavaScript. Python can be used for the backend to perform complex calculations and generate the budgeting plan. JavaScript can be used for the frontend to provide a user-friendly and interactive interface for users to input their financial details.


Basic Workflow:
1. User Input: Users will input their financial details, including total annual net household revenue, state of residence or employment, tax-related information, financial goals, and other relevant variables.
2. Tax Calculation: The program will calculate tax liability based on the American graduated tax brackets and incorporate tax deductibles and withholdings to determine take-home pay.
3. Budgeting Plan Generation: Spearmint will create a personalized budgeting plan based on the user's take-home pay, financial goals, and cost of living analysis.
4. User Interaction: Users can interact with the generated budgeting plan, making adjustments and setting priorities for different spending categories.
5. Budget Visualization: The program will present the budgeting plan in a visually appealing manner, allowing users to understand their financial allocations effectively.
6. Error Handling: The program will include error handling to handle any unexpected inputs or calculation issues.


Basic I/O Details:
spearmint will have a user interface where users can input their financial data and preferences. The program will then process this information and generate the personalized budgeting plan. The output will be presented to the user through the same user interface, allowing them to review and modify the budget as needed.

The backend will handle the data processing and calculations, while the frontend will display the results and enable user interaction. Data security measures, such as encryption and secure storage, will be implemented to protect user financial information.
