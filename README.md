# spearmint

spearmint is a program that creates a custom, personalized budgeting plan based on user-inputted context variables, goals, and preferences. 

It calculates take-home pay based on total annual net household revenue, state of residence and/or state of employment, tax liability (as a % of total household income) based on American gradated tax brackets, tax deductibles and withholdings (e.g. 401k or Roth IRA contributions, but anything on W-9 is fair game), cost of living, etc.
